<b>Limitation</b></p>

I use 4 bytes unsigned int for saving frequency of char by haffman encoding.
The 4 bytes of unsigned int ranges from 0 to 4,294,967,295.
If the numberâ€™s calculation like frequency or file size are larger than 4,294,967,295, it will be overflow.
So, be sure that your files is not beyond than 4,294,967,295.
